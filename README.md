### Mobile

12. []{#Mobile .anchor}**Mobile**

> **Objectives**
>
> Does the mobile application you\'re testing show up in a browser on
> the device? Perhaps you\'re working with a native Android application
> but you don\'t have access to the source code. Maybe the native
> Android application is developed in-house. TestComplete provides
> testing mechanisms that make the best use for each approach. This
> chapter shows how TestComplete handles mobile web applications that
> may have multiple layouts based on screen dimension, \"black-box\"
> native Android applications where you don\'t have access to the
> application\'s internals and \"white-box\" native Android applications
> that are open to inspection.

[]{#_bookmark209 .anchor}

> **Mobile Testing Strategies**
>
> Here are some questions that can help determine which TestComplete
> feature will work best for your needs:
>
> Do you need to test a mobile site on a wide variety of devices,
> regardless of manufacturer and operating system, for example, iPhone,
> Android, Blackberry, Windows and so on?
>
> Do you need to test a mobile site that uses responsive design, that
> is, where the page layout changes based on device characteristics and
> dimensions?
>
> Do you need access to a device\'s GPS or hardware sensors? Do you need
> access to the internal objects of an application? Are you testing
> Xamarin applications?
>
> The [Mobile Web]{.underline} testing option covers the greatest number
> of devices. In mobile web testing, TestComplete virtual browsers can
> be configured to any set of device characteristics and dimensions.
> This option is relatively easy to set up, leverages your existing
> knowledge of testing web applications and doesn\'t require that you
> have the actual physical devices. This option is also very good at
> testing sites that make heavy use of responsive design. The drawback
> is that you will not have access to the devices internal objects or
> hardware.
>
> Within the [Android]{.underline} category, there are two approaches
> for native Java applications that you can use separately or
> mix-and-match. If you don\'t have access to the application\'s source
> code, you can perform black-box testing using [Image Based
> Testing]{.underline}. TestComplete has a powerful mechanism that
> recognizes images on the screen and allows you to work with that area
> of the screen programmatically and through keyword tests. If you have
> access to an Android application\'s source code, you can perform
> white-box testing by configuring the application as an [Open Android
> Application]{.underline}. This will provide you with deep access to an
> Android application\'s internal screen objects and hardware. Android
> is fully supported and iOS is on the way.
>
> []{#Mobile_Web .anchor}**Mobile Web**
>
> Verifying that websites work on all devices, dimensions and platforms
> has become a major scalability challenge. You certainly can\'t keep a
> junkyard full of physical devices and emulator platforms usually
> require download and configuration of one or more libraries for
> support. TestComplete approach is to create *virtual browsers* that
> run with a set of characteristics and dimensions that mimic a
> particular physical device. TestComplete comes with a stock set of
> pre-configured virtual browsers that run from the test recording
> toolbar.

> Be aware that TestComplete uses the Chrome browser, no matter what
> browser the actual device is using. Be sure to [[prepare Chrome for
> Web
> Testing]{.underline}](http://support.smartbear.com/viewarticle/62859/?_ga=1.49190255.819616413.1378486108)
> and also [[install
> Chrome]{.underline}](http://support.smartbear.com/downloads/testcomplete/chrome-patches/?_ga=1.49190255.819616413.1378486108)
> [[patches]{.underline}](http://support.smartbear.com/downloads/testcomplete/chrome-patches/?_ga=1.49190255.819616413.1378486108)
> to match the Chrome version you have.

#### Using Virtual Browsers in Keyword Tests

> Mobile web tests use the **Run Virtual Browser** and **Virtual Browser
> Loop** operations instead of their standard browser counterparts **Run
> Browser** and **Browser Loop**. When you drag the **Run Virtual
> Browser** operation to the keyword tested editor, first select a
> virtual browser from the list and click the **Next** button.

![](./media/image235.png){width="5.680190288713911in" height="4.375in"}

> In the **Operation Parameters** page of the wizard, enter the **URL**
> the virtual browser should navigate to. You can also specify the
> number of seconds to wait while the page loads. Click the **Finish**
> button to add the operation to the test.

![](./media/image236.png){width="3.73584864391951in" height="1.65in"}

> From here you can use the **Web** group of keyword operations just as
> you would for standard [cross browser testing]{.underline}. The
> example keyword test below shows the **Run Virtual Browser** operation
> followed by a standard web **Navigate** operation to
> [www.smartbear.com.](http://www.falafel.com/) The **Navigate**
> operates against the **Current Browser**, so the actual run of the
> test loads the site into the virtual browser.

![](./media/image237.png){width="5.940080927384077in"
height="0.4793744531933508in"}

#### Defining Your Own Virtual Browsers

> As new devices become available, you can define them without waiting
> for SmartBear to update the list. You will need a *user agent string*
> and the dimensions of the device.
>
> The characteristics of the device are defined by a user agent string;
> here\'s an example of a user agent string for Apple\'s iPhone 5:
>
> Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 6\_1\_4 like Mac OS X)
>
> AppleWebKit/536.26 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/6.0 Mobile/10B350
> Safari/8536.25
>
> To learn more about user agent strings, you can Google for lists of
> user agent strings and even utilities that will return the user agent
> string for the device you\'re browsing from.
>
> The following lab will show you how to set up a new device. For this
> example, we will set up a Nokia Lumia 920 with dimensions 480 x 800.

51. From the TestComplete menu, open the **Tools** menu and select
    **Current Project Properties**.

52. In the left-hand tree-view, select **Open Applications \| Web
    Testing \| Virtual Browsers**. This step will display all of the
    current virtual browsers (see the screenshot below).

![](./media/image238.png){width="5.985in" height="3.255in"}

53. Click the **Add\...** button.

54. In the **Add Virtual Browser** dialog, paste the user agent string
    (see below), then click the **Next** button.

> Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows Phone 8.0; Trident/6.0;
> IEMobile/10.0; ARM; Touch; NOKIA; Lumia 920)

55. Enter the screen dimensions as 480 x 800 and click the **Next**
    button. Note that the prompt is for \"CSS pixels\". Typically, the
    browser and device screen dimensions are identical. In some cases,
    the physical device screen may have more pixels than the browser
    screen.

![](./media/image239.png){width="4.152938538932633in"
height="2.46875in"}

56. Enter a browser name that will show up in the **Name** column of the
    **Virtual Browsers**

> list and click the **Finish** button.

![](./media/image240.png){width="3.1820078740157482in"

> The next time you record a test, the new entry will show in the
> drop-down list and will be available for keyword and script tests to
> use.

> []{#Android .anchor}**Android**
>
> If you need greater control of an Android device than [[Mobile
> Web]{.underline}](#Mobile_Web) testing in a browser can provide,
> TestComplete has two solutions. For the best control but requiring
> knowledge of how to program an Android application, configure an [Open
> Android Application]{.underline}. This will open up the gates to an
> Android application\'s internal objects, sensors, GPS, operating
> system commands and so on. If you don\'t have access to the source,
> you can still use [[ Image Based Testing]{.underline}](\l) to access
> on-screen objects using image recognition. TestComplete image
> recognition handles differences between devices, resolutions, even
> minor variations in pixels and colors.

#### The Mobile Screen

> The **Mobile Screen** is the primary tool for testing physical
> devices. It is a device emulator with mobile testing capabilities and
> an interface used to record keyword and script tests. The Mobile
> Screen allows you to interact with a variety of devices in a
> standardized UI, create mobile checkpoints, add images to \"image
> sets\", take screenshots, record multi- touch gestures and install
> [Android Agent]{.underline} for use in \"white box\", [Open
> Android]{.underline} [Applications]{.underline}. The Mobile Screen can
> emulate devices hooked up through USB, Android SDK emulators and
> virtual machines running the Android OS (such as Oracle\'s
> VirtualBox).

![](./media/image242.jpeg){width="2.6758562992125983in" height="5.61in"}

> **Note**: The Mobile Screen connects only to devices hooked up via USB
> cable or some emulation of USB. Wi-Fi connections are not supported.
>
> You should interact with the Mobile Screen using keyboard, mouse or
> touchpad, rather than directly with the physical device. The only
> exception is that *gestures*, input involving multiple touches, are
> performed directly on a device.
>
> To get started using the Mobile Screen, click the **Show Mobile
> Screen** button that appears on the Test Engine toolbar.

> If no device is connected, you\'ll get a warning. If there\'s only a
> single device available it will connect and run. If multiple devices
> are connected, the **Select Current Device** window displays. You can
> **Connect** to a single device or **Connect All**. The screenshot
> below shows a connected physical Samsung device (\"SCH-I535\") and an
> Android SDK emulator. After connecting, display the Mobile Screen by
> selecting a device and clicking the **OK** button.

#### Using TestedApp to Manage Packages

> Packages contain Android application definitions in the form of .apk
> files. You can install and launch these applications in TestedApps,
> keyword tests and scripts.
>
> You can define a package in a **TestedApp** and run the TestedApp from
> the TestComplete IDE, from a Keyword Test or from script. To create a
> TestedApp representing an Android Package:

1.  In the Project Explorer, Select, the **TestedApps** node.

![](./media/image248.png){width="2.279501312335958in"
height="2.18625in"}

2.  In the TestedApps editor, right-click and select **Add Android
    Application\...** from the context menu.

![](./media/image249.png){width="4.227226596675416in"
height="4.630311679790026in"}

3.  Define the path for the **Android application package file**. The
    path will point to the location of the .apk file on your local PC
    where TestComplete resides or in a shared network location. Select
    the **Deploy to the device on start** checkbox then click the **OK**
    button.

![](./media/image250.png){width="5.573920603674541in" height="3.7125in"}

4.  Now that you have defined the TestedApp, right-click the item and
    click **Run Selected**

> from the context menu.

![](./media/image251.png){width="5.905713035870516in"
height="4.102916666666666in"}

> The package will be loaded to the default device and will also show in
> the Mobile Screen. If the package was already loaded to the device it
> will be *refreshed*, that is, it will be deleted and reloaded to the
> device.
>
> For more on how to run a TestedApp from the IDE, keyword test or
> script, see the [[Running]{.underline}](#running-a-testedapp) [[a
> TestedApp]{.underline}](#running-a-testedapp) topic.

#### Using Keyword Tests to Manage Packages

> If you want to install an Android package and then run that package in
> a separate step, leave the TestedApp **Deploy to the device on start**
> option unchecked. The **Install Package** keyword operation from the
> **Mobile** group will load the package to the device without having to
> run it. The screenshot below shows the **Install Package** operation
> followed by the **Run Tested App** operation from the **Test Actions**
> group.

![](./media/image252.png){width="5.917707786526684in"
height="0.5606244531933509in"}

#### Managing Devices with Keyword Tests

> The **Mobile** group in the keyword test editor has methods and
> properties for all devices connected to TestComplete on your PC.

![](./media/image253.png){width="2.141907261592301in" height="3.4375in"}

> Mobile actions are run either on a device that you specify from a list
> or are applied to the *current device*. The **Select Device**
> operation specifies the current device that all future operations
> should run on. The **Parameterized Device** option allows you to
> select both a device *and an index* (assuming there are multiple
> devices with the same name). Choose the device from the **Select
> Device** dialog list and then click **Finish**.

![](./media/image254.png){width="4.6886734470691165in"
height="2.8256244531933508in"}

> To run the same operations against multiple devices, by drag the
> **Device Loop** operation onto the keyword test. This will display the
> **Device Loop** dialog to either Iterate through All **Connected
> Devices** or choose from a list using the **Iterate Through Specific
> Devices** option. Each iteration of the loop makes one of the
> connected devices the current device.

![](./media/image255.png){width="4.621738845144357in"
height="2.7395833333333335in"}

> With access to a device, you can run operations to [install and run
> packages on the device](#using-keyword-tests-to-manage-packages),
> touch the device surface, send keystrokes, [[touch
> images]{.underline}](#using-image-sets-in-keyword-tests) and [[play
> gestures]{.underline}](#gestures). The screenshot example below uses
> the **Image Touch** operation to open the Clock application, then
> performs a series of **Device Touch** operations to navigate to the
> world clock tab, add a city and use the **Device Keys** operation to
> enter \"San Francisco\".

![](./media/image256.png){width="5.928935914260717in"
height="1.0817705599300087in"}

##### Using the On-Screen Action

> The **Mobile** section has a sampling of general-purpose operations,
> but the **On-Screen Action** operation of the **Test Actions** group
> allows you to access the very powerful **Mobile Device** object. The
> Device goody bag includes properties for all device\'s information,
> access to the **Desktop** object that represents the device\'s screen,
> **GPS** and **Sensor** objects, simulate an **SMS**, and the ability
> to **Drag**/**Swipe**/**Touch**/**TouchAndHold**/
> **TouchPress**/**TouchRelease**. You can also execute Android shell
> commands and even **Reboot** the device. The screenshot below shows
> some of the methods for the **Mobile.**
>
> **Device()** object.

![](./media/image257.png){width="5.879571303587052in"
height="5.15625in"}

> The **On-Screen Action** operation dialog provides help with the
> parameters so you don\'t have to guess values. For example, the
> **PressButton** method expects a predefined button value. If you
> happen to know that **mbkHome** constant is actually a 4, then all is
> well. But selecting from a drop-down list is easier and more reliable.
> The screenshot below shows the mbkHome key constant being selected
> from a list.

![](./media/image258.png){width="3.318231627296588in"
height="1.8768744531933508in"}

#### Image Based Testing

> You can\'t always count on having a prepared, \"white-box\"
> application that is open and lets you easily get at all the controls
> on-screen. You won\'t always have that kind of access. In these cases,
> you can test based on recognizing images. A series of objections pop
> to mind, like \"what about devices that have different sizes and
> resolutions?\", \"if I change color scheme or theme, will the image
> recognition fail?\", and \"will colors bleeding through transparent
> areas of images fool the image recognition?\" TestComplete has
> intelligent mechanisms to recognize images in all of these situations,
> including variable percentages of pixel variation and transparency.
>
> The heart of the approach is the **ImageRepository** in the Project
> Explorer. The ImageRepository has **Image Sets** where each set
> contains multiple images representing a single on-screen object. The
> screenshot below shows the ImageRepository node with two image sets
> named \"Calculator\" and \"HomeScreen\".

![](./media/image259.png){width="2.2128324584426946in"
height="1.4025in"}

> Let\'s say you want to automate a clock icon on your device\'s home
> screen. The icon may be displayed using more than one image, depending
> on manufacturer and operating system version. Resolution can also
> vary, for example, when displayed by a Samsung Galaxy running in
> 720x1280 pixels vs. an HTC One running in 540x960. By using an Image
> Set you can recognize images for any configuration. The screenshot
> below shows the \"HomeScreen\" in the **Image Set Editor** where the
> clock is listed under **Items** on the left-hand side. The **Image
> Strip** at the bottom of the screen has a high-quality image of the
> clock from a device with 720x1280 resolution and another image taken
> from the emulator that only runs at 240x320. The resolutions are
> different, the actual artwork representing the clock is different, and
> the scary part is that the background colors are different based on
> the chosen wallpaper.
>
> When using a Keyword Test or script to reference the Clock object,
> TestComplete looks through the Image Strip and tries to match the
> image with the application under test. If it doesn\'t find the image,
> TestComplete moves to the next image in the strip and tries again.
> This mechanism handles varying resolutions and even helps recognize
> objects that use completely different artwork to represent the object.

![](./media/image260.jpeg){width="5.886568241469816in"
height="4.574998906386702in"}

> What if the wallpaper on the device changes or there is some variation
> in the pixel quality between devices? The **Image Parameters** section
> of the Image Set Editor allow tolerance of color or pixel variations.
> **Color tolerance** accepts a number between 0..255 where zero (the
> default) requires that colors match the stored image exactly and 255
> where pixels of any color are treated as identical. **Pixel
> Tolerance** is the number of pixels that can different from the stored
> Image Strip item. By default, Pixel Tolerance is 0 and all pixels in
> the tested application and the Image Strip item must match exactly.
> The slider below the Pixel tolerance spinner allows you to quickly set
> the percentage of pixel difference that will be allowed, without
> having to know about the number of pixels in the image.

##### Adding Images

> You can conveniently add new images to an Image Set by clicking the
> **Add Image** button on [[The Mobile
> Screen]{.underline}](#the-mobile-screen).

### Web Services Testing

13. []{#Web_Services_Testing .anchor}**Web Services Testing**

> **Objectives**
>
> This chapter discusses web services in general and looks at
> TestComplete support for testing web services. You\'ll learn how to
> import a web service and call a web service function directly in a
> test. You\'ll use Web Services Checkpoint and XML Checkpoint to verify
> results between test runs.
>
> []{#_bookmark230 .anchor}**Overview of Web Services**
>
> Web Services provide a standardized SOAP based mechanism for calling
> functions across a network of computers where the remote computer
> executes the specified routine and returns the results. From the
> calling computer a request is made using the SOAP protocol and the web
> service provided will execute the function specified and return the
> result.

> **Figure 194 \--Diagram of a Web Services Call**
>
> SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol and is a standardized
> format for calling functions on remote computers.
>
> In order to work with Web Services, you must have access to a WSDL
> (Web Services Description Language) document that describes the
> available functions, their parameters and results. By importing the
> WSDL document into TestComplete, Web Services calls can be made using
> the Web Services checkpoint.
>
> You can use Web Services to supply data used in a test or you can test
> a Web Service itself. Web Services can be used directly from Keyword
> Tests or Script and the results used as just another data source.
>
> []{#Web_Service_Example .anchor}**Web Service Example**
>
> First, let\'s take a look at a sample web service that contains a
> number of math related functions. The web service is located at this
> URL:

> [http:*//training.falafel.com/testcompletews/*](http://training.falafel.com/testcompletews/)
>
> Using a web browser to hit the above URL, you can see a listing of the
> available functions provided by the web service. A link to the WSDL
> document (the link that reads \"Service Description\" in the
> screenshot below) describes the structure of each request and
> response. If you click on the \"Service Description\" link you will
> see the WSDL XML document that fully describes the web service.

### Distributed Testing

14. []{#_bookmark242 .anchor}**Distributed Testing**

> **Objectives**
>
> This chapter looks at TestComplete Distributed Testing features and
> illustrates how you can use this feature to leverage multiple machines
> during test execution. You'll learn how to create projects for use in
> distributed testing and how to make them available to remote machines.
> You\'ll also explore some of the issues with executing and
> synchronizing tests on multiple computers.

About the Network Suite
-----------------------

> Distributed tests are executed using the Project Explorer. To enable
> Distributed Testing within a project it is necessary to add the
> **Network Suite** Project Item. The Network Suite contains sub-nodes
> allowing you to configure which tests will execute and on which
> machines. The machine running the Distributed Test functions as a
> heads-up display, allowing you to monitor the status of the machines
> participating in the test.
>
> All of the machines participating in a Distributed Test must be using
> the same version of TestComplete.

#### Single Machine Test Execution

> To get a better understanding of how Distributed Testing works let\'s
> first take a look at how a single project works on one machine. In the
> illustration below we can see a single machine connected to a source
> code repository running a project where tests are executed locally.

![](./media/image304.jpeg){width="5.932162073490813in"
height="1.8525in"}

> **Figure 219 \--Single Project Executing on a Single CPU**
>
> In this setup the machine running TestComplete (or TestExecute) pulls
> the project source files from the repository and executes the test.
> Because the tests run synchronously, the total runtime is one hour.

#### Multiple Machine Test Execution

> Now, let\'s look at the same test run in a Distributed Testing
> environment using the Network Suite. In the illustration below, we see
> a single driver machine running a copy of TestComplete which controls
> test execution on multiple host machines running either TestComplete
> or TestExecute. All of the machines have access to the project, which
> contains the Network Suite Project Item, from the repository. In this
> setup the total running time of the project takes only 15 minutes as
> each machine executes different tests within the project.

height="3.3881244531933508in"}

> **Figure 220 \--Running Parts of a Project Across Multiple Machines**
>
> In fact, this example illustrates just one scenario for Distributed
> Testing where all of the machines execute tests from a single project.
> However, tests can be executed from any project that has the Network
> Suite Project Item and do not have to be related in any significant
> way. TestComplete Distributed Testing features allow testers to tailor
> test execution to cover a wide variety of scenarios.

Setting up a Distributed Test
-----------------------------

> Now we can begin to add Hosts and Jobs to our Network Suite to
> construct a Distributed Test.

#### Working With Hosts

##### Adding Hosts

> Under the **NetworkSuite**, **Hosts** are machines that will execute
> as part of a Distributed Test. From the **Project Explorer** you can
> double click the **Hosts** node to view the Hosts editor window in the
> Workspace and all of the hosts configured for the Distributed Test
> will appear in the list.
>
> To add a Host to the NetworkSuite:

1.  Right click the Hosts node and select **Add \| New Item\...** from
    the context menu. On the Create Project Item dialog specify \"LAB1\"
    for the Name field and click the **OK** button.

> **Figure 226 \-- Adding a Host**

2.  In the Hosts Editor, set the **Address** column to the IP address or
    use the ellipsis to choose the machine by network name.

3.  Under the **Base Path** column assign a path relative to the Host
    machine (we\'re using \"C:

> \\Temp\" in this case).

4.  Under the **Source Path** column assign the file path to the
    Project\'s .MDS file.

##### Hosts Editor Columns

> The Hosts Editor has the following columns:

  **Column**       **Description**
  ---------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Name**         The name used to refer to the host from scripts, keyword tests and from the task properties.
  **Address**      The network name or IP address of the computer that the new host is mapped to.
  **Login Mode**   The Manual option requires the remote machine to be logged into before running the test. The Automatic RDB Session connects to the remote computer using Remote Desktop and leaves the computer locked and unavailable to users. The Automatic RDB Session connects to the remote computer using Remote Desktop but moves the session to the remote computer\'s console, leaving the computer unlocked and available for use.
  **Domain**       Specifies the domain to which the user specified in the User name column belongs.
  **User name**    Specifies the account used to open a user session on the slave computer automatically when verifying or running the network suite.
  **Password**     Specifies the password used to open a user session on the slave computer automatically when verifying or running the network suite. If the parameter is skipped, TestComplete will use an empty string.

  **Column**        **Description**
  ----------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Base path**     Specifies the common path for several projects, which are located on the computer specified by the Address property. TestComplete uses this value to prefix paths specified by a task's Path property.
  **Source path**   Specifies the path to the folder (located on the master computer) holding the slave project that can be copied from the master computer to the host computer. The path should be relative to the master computer.

> There are several other useful items available from the context menu
> on the Hosts Editor including

height="2.65625in"}

> **Figure 228 \--Hosts Editor Context Menu**

##### Verifying the Host Connection

> Due to the fact that remote machines may not be configured properly,
> TestComplete provides an option to verify the connection to a Host
> machine. You can use the context menu **Verify** option from the
> **Host Editor** as well as the **Project Explorer** context menu on
> the **Hosts** node.

> **Figure 229 \--Verifying a Host connection**
>
> Refer to TestComplete online help for Firewall configuration details.

##### Copying the Project to the Host

> Now that we\'ve verified the connection and setup our project we can
> copy it to the host machine to prepare for execution. Once we finish
> configuring our test we may want to perform this step again to ensure
> all of our updates are on the Host machine. In practice, tests should
> be stored in a source control repository and loaded onto the host
> machines from there.
>
> 1\. Right click the \"LAB1\" host entry in the Hosts Editor window and
> select **Copy Project to Slave** from the context menu.

#### Synchronizing Computers

> A **SynchPoint** delays execution of a test until all computers with
> that SynchPoint reach the synchronization point. When all the
> computers with a named SynchPoint hit that Synchronize Point, they
> will continue on with their test. An example of an effective use for
> SynchPoints: you want to avoid where two or more users try to edit the
> same record at the same time and post the data.

height="1.381874453193351in"}

> **Figure 232 \--SyncPoints**

##### Using SynchPoint in Keyword Tests

> To use a SynchPoint, use a **Run Code Snippet** Operation and add the
> **NetworkSuite. Synchronize()** method, passing the name of the
> SynchPoint (\"WaitForMe\" in the example).
>
> **NetworkSuite**.Synchronize(\"WaitForMe\");
> **NetworkSuite**.Synchronize(\"WaitForMe\")

Executing Distributed Tests
---------------------------

> There are several options for executing Distributed Tests including
> manually in the Project Explorer, from Keyword Tests and from Script.

#### Manual Execution

> The easiest option is to use the context menu from the Project
> Explorer. You can execute either individual Jobs or specific Tasks
> within a job directly from the context menus.

> ![](./media/image319.png){width="4.776375765529309in"
> height="4.104374453193351in"}

#### Keyword Test Execution

> You can execute a Distributed Test from a Keyword Test using the Run
> Test Operation, opening up the NetworkSuite test category and
> selecting the Job or Task that you want to run.

> **Figure 233 \--Running Distributed Test**

#### Runtime Behavior

> TestComplete uses Windows Remote Desktop to display the remote
> computer as the test runs. You will need to configure your remote
> computer to accept Remote Desktop connections for the distributed test
> to work. See the documentation for your operating system for more
> information on accepting Remote Desktop connections.

Lab: Simple Distributed Test
----------------------------

#### Configure The Project

1.  Create a master project with a NetworkSuite Project Item.

2.  Create a hosted (slave) project with a **NetworkSuite** Project
    Item.

![](./media/image314.png){width="3.7453094925634294in"
height="2.4166666666666665in"}

> **Figure 235 \--Verifying the Host**

3.  Add \"Notepad.exe\" to the **TestedApps** project Item of the hosted
    project.

4.  Modify the **File Path** property of the TestedApp to **\"\"**
    (blank).

#### Record a Test

1.  Create (or record) a script method to type something into notepad.
    For example:

> **var** p1;
>
> **var** w1; TestedApps.notepad.Run();
>
> p1 = Sys.Process(\"notepad\");
>
> w1 = p1.Window(\"Notepad\", \"\*\").Window(\"Edit\"); w1.Click(135,
> 29);
>
> w1 = p1.Window(\"Notepad\", \"\*\");
>
> w1.Window(\"Edit\").Keys(\"TestComplete Training - Distributed
> Testing\"); w1.Close();
> Aliases.notepad.dlgNotepad.DirectUIHWND.CtrlNotifySink.btnDontSave.ClickButton();
>
> **Dim** p1
>
> **Dim** w1 TestedApps.notepad.Run()
>
> p1 = Sys.Process(\"notepad\")
>
> w1 = p1.Window(\"Notepad\", \"\*\").Window(\"Edit\") w1.Click(135, 29)
>
> w1 = p1.Window(\"Notepad\", \"\*\")
>
> w1.Window(\"Edit\").Keys(\"TestComplete Training - Distributed
> Testing\") w1.**Close**()
>
> Aliases.notepad.dlgNotepad.DirectUIHWND.CtrlNotifySink.btnDontSave.ClickButton()

2.  Save the project.

#### Create the Distributed Test

1.  Select the **NetworkSuite** Project Item in the Master Project and
    enter the path to the project suite in the **Shared Path**.

2.  Expand the **Hosts** Project Item and select \"Host1\"

3.  Enter the name (or IP address) of the hosting (slave) computer.

4.  In the **Base** path property enter \"\\\\\<Master Computer
    Name\>\\\<Name of Project Suite directory\>\"

5.  Right-click on \"Host1\" and select **Verify** from the context
    menu.

6.  Expand the **Jobs** Project Item.

7.  Expand the \"Job1\" Project Item.

8.  Select the \"Task1\" Project Item.

9.  In the **Path** property enter \"\\\<Name of Hosted
    Project\>\\\<Name of Hosted Project\>. mds\".

10. In the **Copy remote log** property select \"\[Always\]\". 11.In the
    **Use previous instance** property select \"\[Use\]\".

<!-- -->

12. In the **Test** property enter the path to your test on the hosted
    machine. If you\'re running a Keyword Test then the path might be
    similar to \"\<Name of Hosted
    Project\>\\KeywordTests\\Test1\\Test1\". If running a Script then
    the path would look something like this path: \"\<Name of Hosted
    Project\>\\Script\\Unit1\\Test1\".

13. Right-click \"Task1\" and select **Verify** from the context menu.

14. Right-click the **NetworkSuite** project item and select **Run**
    from the context menu.

### Manual Testing

Manual Testing
==============

Objectives
----------

> This chapter looks at TestComplete support for Manual Testing
> including how to create, edit and execute Manual Tests. You\'ll learn
> about the upgrade path from manual to automatic tests using the
> TestComplete import and export features. You\'ll also learn how to use
> events within a manual test to allow interaction between manual and
> automated tests.

About Manual Testing
--------------------

> If you've worked in any sort of Quality Assurance capacity you\'ll
> likely be intimately familiar with manual testing and perhaps more so
> than you might like. Manual testing while extremely valuable can be
> difficult for humans to perform consistently over long periods of time
> because of human nature itself. Manual testing generally takes a great
> deal of concentration and dedicated effort to consistently produce
> results. TestComplete provides an alternative to what could be
> considered the more classical approach of using Microsoft Word or
> Excel. TestComplete support for manual testing allows the test
> developer to guide the tester through a series of steps, capture data
> as the test is being performed and automatically log the results of
> the test. The benefits of manual testing through TestComplete are:
>
> The assurance that the required steps are followed Generation of a log
> file for every test execution Verification of the results based on
> Test Log contents Ability to interact with a manual test using Events
>
> Below is an example of the TestComplete manual test user interface:

> **Figure 238 \--Creating the Manual Test Item**

#### Manual Test Editor

> The TestComplete Manual Test Editor allows for the creation of a
> multi-step test that prompts the user through a series of
> instructions, collecting results with every step.

![](./media/image325.png){width="5.929561461067366in"
height="3.8906244531933507in"}

> **Figure 239 \--Manual Test Editor**

#### Manual Test Editor Controls

  **Field**               **Description**
  ----------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Test Steps**          Tree of the steps contained within this test, used for navigation while editing.
  **Test Caption**        Window caption of the Manual Test dialog.
  **ID**                  Step ID for use within Manual Test events.
  **Test Description**    Sub caption of the Manual Test dialog.
  **Test Instructions**   Free-form HTML markup for communicating the actual actions to be performed during the test. Appears in the main portion of the Manual Test dialog.

  **Field**                     **Description**
  ----------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Test notes and comments**   Notes for the test writer that are not displayed when the test is executed.

#### Editing the Test Description

> By default, the **Manual Test Editor** opens with only the initial
> node created so we\'ll need to add steps to fill out the test. To
> create a Manual Test description:

1.  Click the **Test Caption** field and enter \"Create Order Manual
    Test\".

2.  Edit the **Test Description** field and set the text to \"In this
    test we will create a new customer order and validate a new record
    is created.\"

3.  Edit the **Test Instructions** field and set the test to \"Using the
    Orders sample application we will add a new order and verify the
    data appears in the list of customer orders.\" The result should
    look like the following:

![](./media/image326.png){width="5.93113188976378in" height="3.88125in"}

> **Figure 240 \--The Manual Test Editor w ith Test Description**

#### Adding Steps

> Once the description is completed we can start adding steps to the
> test as follows:

1.  Click the green (+) sign or right click in the Test Steps area and
    select **New Step** from the context menu.

> **Figure 243 \--Selecting a Test**

Manual Test Interaction With Automated Tests
--------------------------------------------

> In this topic we\'ll illustrate how manual tests interact with
> automated tests. You can call a manual test from a Keyword Test or
> Script. The reverse is also true. You an call Keyword Tests or Script
> from your manual test.
>
> You might be thinking \"Why would I do this?\" which is a fair
> question. The interesting thing about Manual Tests in TestComplete is
> that you can augment a test by performing actions automatically for
> the user and by incorporating a Manual Test into a Keyword Test or
> Script you can execute any actions necessary to ease the testing
> process such as setup test data, create/delete files, launch
> applications etc. You can also replace parts of your manual test
> incrementally as circumstances dictate, allowing you to move over to
> automated testing in a controlled manner.

#### Running Keyword Tests from Manual Tests

> Not only can you kick off a Manual Test from a Keyword Test, you can
> also run Keyword Tests from your Manual Test. For example, if on
> \"STEP\_2\", you need the tester to start the \"Orders\" application,
> you can have this done automatically from the keyword test. The
> screenshot below, shows the original manual step that requires the
> user to type a certain path into the Run dialog.

#### Converting Manual Tests to Keyword Tests

> TestComplete provides extensive support for converting your existing
> manual tests to automated Keyword Tests. There are two related
> functions on the Test Steps toolbar that help you to convert from
> manual to Keyword Tests.

![](./media/image332.jpeg){width="2.90873687664042in"
height="0.9902077865266842in"}

> The **Convert Manual Test to Keyword Test** option launches the
> recorder and creates a keyword test for all your manual test steps.
> The nice thing about this approach is that you can read off the manual
> test step as you record the Keyword Test. The recorder starts and
> stops for each manual test step. Once the recording is complete, a
> prompt asks if you want a Keyword Test created that will call the
> Keyword Tests created for each step. The result looks something like
> this in the Keyword Test Editor:

![](./media/image333.png){width="4.979998906386702in"
height="1.7118744531933507in"}

> **Figure 246 \--Manual Test Converted to Keyw ord Test**
>
> The **Convert Manual Step to Keyword Test** option launches the
> recorder and creates a Keyword Test with the same name as the manual
> test step. Once the recording is complete, you can change the Content
> Type to \"Keyword Test\" and the new Keyword Test will be
> automatically selected.

#### Manual Test Event Handling

> One of the unique features TestComplete brings to manual testing is
> the ability for a test developer to inject actions into the test while
> it\'s being performed. For example, if you wanted to initialize some
> test data, delete certain files or perform Checkpoint validation of
> test data, all of those actions can be performed using the built-in
> Manual Test Events.

> **Figure 247 \--Manual Test Events provided by TestComplete**

Exporting a Manual Test
-----------------------

> Once you\'ve created a manual test you\'re given two options to export
> the test content using the context menu to either Microsoft Word or
> HTML:

![](./media/image335.png){width="3.47748687664042in"
height="4.145833333333333in"}

> **Figure 248 \--Exporting Manual Tests**
>
> TestComplete provides an option to customize the Microsoft Word export
> template on the Properties tab at the bottom of the editor window. The
> export functionality works in a mail merge like fashion and allows you
> to create a Microsoft Word document containing the contents of the
> test.

> You can optionally, define your own Microsoft Word template for use
> with the TestComplete export feature. TestComplete includes a default
> template that looks like this:

> **Figure 250 --TestComplete Default Microsoft Word Template**

Importing a Manual Test
-----------------------

> The ability to migrate existing legacy manual tests can be a huge time
> saver. TestComplete lets you import manual tests stored in text files,
> Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel files. TestComplete can handle
> several format arrangements:
>
> One level or multilevel, bulleted or numbered lists. Numbered lists
> can use any number style and formatting for levels.
>
> Test steps using different indents for steps of different levels.
> Tables used to organize the step hierarchy.
>
> Keywords to separate the step caption, description, instructions and
> notes.
>
> TestComplete ships with a set of sample files that can be imported.
> Each file demonstrates a particular format, e.g. text, Excel, Word
> document with headers, etc. The closer your files are to the example
> formats, the less editing you will need to perform in the Manual Tests
> editor. See the online help for complete details on supported formats.
>
> You can find example files to import at:
>
> \\TestComplete Samples\\Manual Testing\\Recommended Formats for Manual
> Test Instructions

#### Simple Text File Import

> If you open the document titled \"Test Instructions in .txt file.txt\"
> you will see steps for testing the Orders application that use numbers
> to indicate each step.

Legacy Migration
----------------

> The ability to import legacy manual test steps stored in external
> files coupled with TestComplete tools for converting Manual Test to
> fully automated Keyword Tests comprises a complete migration path.
> This path takes you from the labor-intensive, error prone and
> inconsistent to a wholly automated system that can be run reliably on
> a schedule.

Summary
-------

> In this chapter, we explored TestComplete Manual Testing features and
> discussed the advantages of developing manual tests using
> TestComplete. We learned to:
>
> Create, edit and execute Manual Tests. Call Manual Tests.
>
> Use Events within a Manual Test. Import and Export Manual Tests.

### Low Level Procedures

Low Level Procedures
====================

Objectives
----------

> This chapter explains TestComplete Low Level Procedure functionality
> and how it can be leveraged to deal with situations where they may be
> no easy alternative. You'll learn how to record, edit and execute Low
> Level Procedures. Along the way you will learn how Low-Level
> Procedures differ from standard test recordings, when to use a
> Low-Level Procedure and the difference between Window and Screen Low
> Level Procedures.

About Low Level Procedures
--------------------------

> Low Level Procedures are an alternative recording type provided by
> TestComplete where actual mouse and keyboard events are recorded. Low
> Level Procedures differ dramatically from standard recordings where
> TestComplete records higher level actions against specific onscreen
> objects.

#### Low Level Procedure Types

> There are two kinds of Low Level Procedures:
>
> **Screen Coordinates** \-- Captures events relative to the entire
> screen where the top left-hand corner of the screen is 0,0.
>
> **Window Coordinates** \-- Captures events relative to a user selected
> Window where the top left-hand corner of the window is 0,0.
>
> Window Coordinate Low Level Procedures tend to be more reliable as
> they are unaffected by the location of the selected window and will
> playback relative to the Window\'s current screen location.

#### When To Use Low Level Procedures

Recording Low Level Procedures
------------------------------

> In the \"Web Testing\" chapter we looked at a Web application that
> used JavaScript to dynamically display menu items on screen. The
> application poses an interesting challenge for GUI recorders that tend
> to capture interactions with controls such as clicks and keystrokes.
> Let\'s take a look at recording a Low-Level Window Coordinates
> Procedure to handle the menu selection and understand this alternative
> approach to recording.

#### Low Level Window Coordinates Procedure

76. For starters we\'ll launch Internet Explorer and browse to the
    Orders application located here:

### User Forms

User Forms
==========

Objectives
----------

> This chapter demonstrates how User Forms are used to display dialogs
> and windows onscreen during test execution. You\'ll learn how to use
> the TestComplete User Form\'s designer to create your own forms.
> You\'ll also see how modal and non-modal display modes manage form
> display during test execution.

[]{#Materials .anchor}

Using the Designer
------------------

> User Forms are not part of the default project template so you\'ll
> first need to add the **User Forms** Project Item to your project.
> Once you\'ve added User Forms support to your project you can right
> click the User Forms node in the Project Explorer and add a form to
> your project. In this example, we\'ll construct a User Form that can
> be used to prompt for login credentials.

![](./media/image355.png){width="2.613190069991251in"
height="1.8356244531933508in"}

> **Figure 268 \--User Forms Login Dialog**
>
> Once the form is created you will see the User Forms designer which is
> similar in style to those seen in Visual Basic, Visual Studio or other
> development tools supporting forms development. If you are familiar
> with any of these tools you\'ll immediately feel right at home in the
> designer. If not, don\'t fear. Learning the designer is quick and easy
> and you\'ll be able to construct dialogs in no time.

#### Layout of the User Forms Designer

> There are three panels of the User Forms editor including:

84. Component palette

85. Form Designer

86. Properties window

> **Figure 269 \--User Form s Editor**

#### Building a User Form

> To illustrate the functionality of the User Forms designer we\'ll
> build a Login dialog that you can call from within your tests. If the
> UserForms node doesn\'t already exist in the project explorer,
> right-click the project and select **Add \| New Item**. Choose \"User
> Forms\" from the list and click **OK** to create the project item.

> []{#Calling_User_Forms_in_a_Keyword_Test .anchor}**Calling User Forms
> in a Keyword Test**
>
> User Forms can be displayed from within a Keyword test using several
> different operations such as **Call Object Method**, **Run Code
> Snippet**, or **Run Script Routine**. In this example we\'ll use the
> **Call Object Method** operation and illustrate how to invoke a modal
> dialog and respond to the user\'s action to the dialog.

#### Creating a Keyword Test to call a User Form

> The first step is to drag/drop a **Call Object Method** onto a Keyword
> test. This will invoke the wizard to select the object and choose the
> specific method. In the case of a User Form there are two methods for
> displaying the form, Show and ShowModal. The prior will display the
> form as a non-modal window and test execution will continue to the
> next operation. The latter will display the form as a modal window
> where a user has to respond to the dialog prior to test execution
> continuing. The ShowModal method returns a value called ModalResult
> representing the user\'s response to the dialog. The ModalResult will
> be one of the following values:

  **Constant**     **Description**
  ---------------- ----------------------------------
  **mrNone**       None.
  **mrOk**         The dialog result is OK.
  **mrCancel**     The dialog result is Cancel.
  **mrAbort**      The dialog result is Abort.
  **mrRetry**      The dialog result is Retry.
  **mrIgnore**     The dialog result is Ignore.
  **mrYes**        The dialog result is Yes.
  **mrNo**         The dialog result is No.
  **mrAll**        The dialog result is All.
  **mrNoToAll**    The dialog result is No To All.
  **mrYesToAll**   The dialog result is Yes To All.

> For this operation, we\'ll specify the **UserForms.PasswordDlg**
> object:

height="3.9895833333333335in"}

> **Figure 275 \--Calling Show Modal**

#### Responding to a User Form

> Once displayed onscreen using the ShowModal method, the user must
> respond to the dialog prior to the test proceeding. The Keyword Test
> will need to respond to the ModalResult returned by the form. We can
> use an **If\...Then** operation to provide the logic. For the login
> dialog we\'ll inspect the form\'s ModalResult, username and password,
> validate the data and perform additional actions based on the result.
> All of these values can be inspected within a single **If\...then**
> operation.
>
> To respond to the User Form:

1.  Drag and drop the **If\...Then** operation just after the call the
    User Form.

2.  Under **Value1** use the ellipsis, set the **Mode** to **Last

3.  Under **Value2** use the ellipsis, set the **Mode** to **Code
    Expression** and enter **mrOk** as the

##### Value.

4.  Click the **And** button to add a new row.

5.  Under **Value1** use the ellipsis, set the **Mode** to **Code
    Expression** and enter

##### UserForms.PasswordDlg.edUsername.Text.

6.  Under **Value2** use the ellipsis, set the **Mode** to **Constant**
    and \"admin\" (without the quotes) as the **Value**.

7.  Under **Value1** use the ellipsis, set the **Mode** to **Code
    Expression** and enter

##### UserForms.PasswordDlg.edPassword.Text.

8.  Under **Value2** use the ellipsis, set the **Mode** to **Constant**
    and \"**password**\" (without the quotes) as the **Value**.

> producing log output though you'll want to be sure and iron out your
> strategy from the start. For example, you may want to setup a web
> server where you can publish results. In fact, TestComplete supports
> exporting log results to HTML which could be a good starting place.
>
> []{#Plan_your_testing,_but_not_that_kind_of_ .anchor}**Plan your

> The preparation we\'re referring to has to do with your choice of

> with respect to the testing facilities available in TestComplete. You

>
> TestComplete is rich with features that make test automation easier
> although like any development tool it provides many different ways to
> solve the same problem. For example, TestComplete has a powerful and
> indeed almost alluring recorder, making it easy to quickly create
> automated tests. While a test recorder is a great tool, recorded tests
> tend to be more brittle than hand written tests because they capture a
> single iteration at a given point in time and don\'t take into account
> unexpected events like an error dialog popping up. The alternative is
> handwritten tests where you can methodically plan how the test will
> react in unexpected circumstances. The down side of handwritten tests
> is they tend to take longer to develop though over the long run
> they\'ll likely require less maintenance because of the tendency to
> design the test more rigorously.
>
> []{#Organizing_your_TestComplete_Projects .anchor}**Organizing your

>
> TestComplete provides the ability to customize the Project Items that

> order to maintain consistency across your testing organization you
> should work towards creating a project template(s) that\'s
> pre-configured for your test environment. For example, if you\'re
> testing a Window 32-bit GUI application, create a Project Template
> that has the Tested Applications node with your application already
> added to it. Also, look closely at how you can utilize Aliases to

> []{#Your_Most_Important_Test .anchor}**Your Most Important Test**
>
> Arguably, the first test you should focus on is a \"smoke test\". In
> this section we\'ll discuss what a smoke test is and provide guidance
> as to how to construct the test in such a way as to maximize its
> effectiveness.

#### Creating a Smoke Test

> Probably the most important test you\'ll write is your Smoke Test, at
> least it should be. Typically, the goal of a Smoke Test is to verify
> that the latest build delivered to QA is either worth further
> consideration or \"DOA\" (dead on arrival). The smoke test is crucial
> because of the time savings it can provide both R&D and QA. A good
> Smoke Test should:
>
> Run quickly \-- a smoke test should not last for hours but minutes and
> test the most crucial functionality.
>
> Fail quickly \-- as soon as a failure is detected in the smoke test
> should end and trigger a failure notification.
>
> Cover a broad range of functionality, focusing on breadth not depth.
> Require minimal setup/configuration of the application under test. Be
> setup to run against every build.
>
> Adapt over time as the application under test evolves. Serve as a
> model for new test automation.
>
> If you take the time to organize your Smoke Test to cover these goals
> you will undoubtedly save time and resources over the long run. Your
> Smoke Test should serve as a model that embodies your \"best
> practices\" from which your QA team can draw from for their own tests.
>
> If you\'ve never written a Smoke Test before, start small. In the
> beginning simply get the smoke test to verify even a single piece of
> functionality consistently. Over time, work to increase its coverage
> but remain focused on the quality of the test. It\'s unacceptable to
> have a Smoke Test that can\'t run consistently and without problems.

#### Executing your Tests Regularly

> Once your Smoke Test is written and under version control the next
> step is to automate its execution. SmartBear has a product called
> Automated Build Studio which can automate your TestComplete tests and
> trigger them to execute when a new build is delivered to QA, a process
> called **Continuous Integration** or **\"CI\"**. In addition to
> Automated Build Studio there are Open Source CI servers such as
> CruiseControl.NET.
>
> The main benefit of a CI server is to reduce the amount of time it
> takes to execute your test automation as well as ensure that it
> executes against every build. By setting up a CI server you can not
> only free your QA engineers from having to manually execute their
> tests. CI helps quickly identify tests that are unable to consistently
> run to completion and may require closer scrutiny. In addition, many
> CI servers include a means of publishing test results providing for
> greater visibility into the automation efforts.

### Appendix B - Types of Testing

20. []{#Appendix_B_-_Types_of_Testing .anchor}**Appendix B - Types of
    Testing**

> []{#Types_of_Testing .anchor}**Types of Testing**

#### Manual Testing

> Manual Testing is where a tester methodically exercises the features
> of a product or product area without the aid of test automation. The
> single greatest strength of manual testing is that it is truly
> real-world testing, meaning that the tester can utilize the
> application under test the same way an end user would. Through manual
> testing the tester can provide a wide variety of feedback about the
> application under test not limited to simply reproducing bugs.
>
> Manual tests are difficult to perform on a regular basis. The major
> weakness of manual testing is that it is time consuming, tedious and
> requires extended periods of focused attention. Manual testing tends
> to be quite error prone, leading to situations where consistently
> reproducing a bug can be very difficult.

#### Functional Testing

> Functional Testing focuses on interactions with an application\'s user
> interface (UI) via the mouse, keyboard or other input device with
> particular attention to how the application visually responds to
> input. The goal of Functional Testing is to methodically cover all of
> the various UI features exposed by an application. Functional Testing
> should be highly organized and structured in a manner that allows for
> additional tests to easily be incorporated as new features are added.

#### Unit Testing

> Unit Testing focuses on smaller atomic portions of an application.
> Typically, Unit Testing requires internal knowledge of how an
> application performs and seeks to test portions (objects, methods and
> function) of an application in isolation. In many cases, applications
> have to be designed with Unit Testing in mind in order for this type
> of testing to be truly effective. The benefit of unit testing is that
> it tends to force application developers to write smaller, well
> defined routines with fewer dependencies allowing for highly specific
> tests to be developed.

#### Regression Testing

> Regression Testing is the process of executing tests in a repeatable
> manner and comparing the latest results with previous test executions
> to ensure that the same outcome is achieved. Regression Testing is
> extremely important and is the means of realizing the value of test
> automation. Repeatedly executing tests over time allows you to verify
> the application is still performing as intended.

#### Distributed Testing

> Distributed Testing is the act of farming different portions of a test
> out to separate machines for execution. Distributed Testing is useful
> for simulating real world interactions on a networked application such
> as a web site or web service and can exercise functionality designed
> to handle concurrent use of application resources including, but not
> restricted to data.

#### HTTP Performance Testing

> HTTP Performance Testing is the simulation of real-world interactions
> with a web application from multiple machines. TestComplete provides
> the ability to leverage networked computers and virtual users to
> simultaneously submit HTTP transactions to a web application.

#### Multi-Tier

> In software development there are typically three Tiers which are used
> to describe various aspects of an application they are Client Tier,
> Middle Tier and Data Tier. These are each defined as:
>
> **Client** \-- The user interface or presentation of an application
> and its data which is typically covered through Functional Testing.
>
> **Data Tier** \-- The storage of an application\'s data which can be
> exercised by Functional Testing as well as Unit Testing
>
> **Middle Tier** \-- Refers to the portion of the application
> responsible for moving data back and forth between the Client and the
> Data Tiers. The code that resides in this Tier can be tested from
> either the Client Tier via Functional testing or through Unit Testing
> on the code in the Middle Tier itself. Keep in mind that these are not
> strict rules as to which type of testing should be used but more
> illustrative how the different types of testing can be used.
